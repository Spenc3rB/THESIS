# Notes

- Focus on literature review of reverse engineering incorporation into model based systems engineering.
- Consider case studies for practical application (make sure they aren't too complex).
- Current thesis topic: "Bottoms-up: Incorporating Reverse Engineering into Model Based Systems Engineering for Cyber-Physical Systems".
- Core question: How can we systematically infer internal structure and behavior from low-level artifacts (binaries, traces, raw I/O) to surface functions and behaviors that were not specified or intended?
  
# Projects to consider incorporating:
- SECURING LEGACY TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: REQUIREMENTS-DRIVEN MITIGATION FOR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (i.e., J1708 protocol vulnerabilities and mitigations)
- Ultimate Truck Hacking Platform (UTHP) (i.e., embedded OS development in conjunction with the NMFTA)
- Patching an Engine Control Module to Enhance Security (i.e., testing process for patching an ECU to enhance security)
- VPTP: Vehicle Penetration Testing Platform (i.e., open source vehicle penetration testing platform for automated security testing in the automotive domain)
- OneNet Testbench (i.e., creating a testbench for the OneNet protocol by reverse engineering the implemnentation available)
- CyberEvent Information Technology (IT) Asset and Attack Surface Management (i.e., reverse engineering the available assets and how to improve the current state of the system)
- yachtDestroy: A vulnerability exposure tool for recreational marine vessels (i.e., reverse engineering and modeling the System of Interest (SoI) connected to a TCP/IP to NMEA 2000 gateway)

- FMSCA ELD Mandate (i.e., reverse engineering and modeling the SoI, an ELD device, to understand vulnerabilities and potential mitigations)
