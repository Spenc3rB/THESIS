# Notes:

## General Notes:
- Focus on literature review of reverse engineering incorporation into model based systems engineering.
- Consider case studies for practical application (make sure they aren't too complex).
- Current thesis topic: "Bottoms-up: A SysML Approach to Reverse Engineering Cyber-Physical Systems".

## 10/04/2025:
- There are 3 types of RE: Protocol Reverse Engineering (PRE), Hardware Reverse Engineering (HRE), Software Reverse Engineering (SRE).
- There are 3 types of RE approaches: Black Box, Gray Box, White Box.
  
# Projects to consider incorporating:
- SECURING LEGACY TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS: REQUIREMENTS-DRIVEN MITIGATION FOR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (i.e., J1708 protocol vulnerabilities and mitigations):
  - White Box PRE <-> SysML
- Ultimate Truck Hacking Platform (UTHP) (i.e., embedded OS development in conjunction with the NMFTA)
  - White Box SRE/HRE/PRE <-> SysML
- Patching an Engine Control Module to Enhance Security (i.e., testing process for patching an ECU to enhance security)
  - Black Box SRE/PRE/HRE <-> SysML
- VPTP: Vehicle Penetration Testing Platform (i.e., open source vehicle penetration testing platform for automated security testing in the automotive domain)
  - Attempt at automating PRE/HRE/SRE <-> SysML (not sure how to incorporate)
- OneNet Testbench (i.e., creating a testbench for the OneNet protocol by reverse engineering the implementation available)
  - Gray Box PRE/SRE/HRE <-> SysML
- CyberEvent Information Technology (IT) Asset and Attack Surface Management (i.e., reverse engineering the available assets and how to improve the current state of the system)
  - White Box SRE/PRE <-> SysML
- yachtDestroy: A vulnerability exposure tool for recreational marine vessels (i.e., reverse engineering and modeling the System of Interest (SoI) connected to a TCP/IP to NMEA 2000 gateway)
  - Gray Box SRE/PRE/HRE <-> SysML
- FMSCA ELD Mandate (i.e., reverse engineering and modeling the SoI, an ELD device, to understand vulnerabilities and potential mitigations)
  - Gray Box SRE/PRE/HRE <-> SysML
