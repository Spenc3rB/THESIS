#  BOTTOMS-UP: A SYSML APPROACH TO REVERSE ENGINEERING CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 🍺
Thesis work done for my Systems Engineering Masters Degree at CSU. This is a WIP repository.

## About

This repository contains code and documentation related to my thesis work in Systems Engineering at Colorado State University. The focus of the thesis is on using SysML as a reconstruction framework for cyber-physical systems, especially in the context of cybersecurity vulnerability management.

> See [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/), [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/), and [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).

## Contributions

- Documentation of the methodology and findings of the thesis.
- Scripts and tools developed during the research.
- SysML profile for Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Systems (CVMS):
  - Custom: CVE and CWE stereotypes and traceability relationships.
- Case Studies applying the CVMS profile to SysML as a reverse engineering framework.

## Repository Structure
