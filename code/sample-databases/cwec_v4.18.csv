1231,Improper Prevention of Lock Bit Modification,"The product uses a trusted lock bit for restricting access to registers, address regions, or other resources, but the product does not prevent the value of the lock bit from being modified after it has been set.",https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1231.html
1232,Improper Lock Behavior After Power State Transition,"Register lock bit protection disables changes to system configuration once the bit is set. Some of the protected registers or lock bits become programmable after power state transitions (e.g., Entry and wake from low power sleep modes) causing the system configuration to be changeable.",https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1232.html
1233,Security-Sensitive Hardware Controls with Missing Lock Bit Protection,"The product uses a register lock bit protection mechanism, but it does not ensure that the lock bit prevents modification of system registers or controls that perform changes to important hardware system configuration.",https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1233.html

1249,Application-Level Admin Tool with Inconsistent View of Underlying Operating System,"The product provides an application for administrators to manage parts of the underlying operating system, but the application does not accurately identify all of the relevant entities or resources that exist in the OS; that is, the application's model of the OS's state is inconsistent with the OS's actual state.",https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1249.html

1250,Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State,The product has or supports multiple distributed components or sub-systems that are each required to keep their own local copy of shared data - such as state or cache - but the product does not ensure that all local copies remain consistent with each other.,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1250.html
1251,Mirrored Regions with Different Values,The product's architecture mirrors regions without ensuring that their contents always stay in sync.,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1251.html
1252,CPU Hardware Not Configured to Support Exclusivity of Write and Execute Operations,The CPU is not configured to provide hardware support for exclusivity of write and execute operations on memory. This allows an attacker to execute data from all of memory.,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1252.html
1253,Incorrect Selection of Fuse Values,The logic level used to set a system to a secure state relies on a fuse being unblown. An attacker can set the system to an insecure state merely by blowing the fuse.,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1253.html
1254,Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity,"The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation.

1258,Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information,"The hardware does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when debug mode is entered.",https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1258.html
1259,Improper Restriction of Security Token Assignment,"The System-On-A-Chip (SoC) implements a Security Token mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity. However, the Security Tokens are improperly protected.",https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1259.html
